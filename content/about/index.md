Hello, my name is Anoop Kunjuraman. I live in Plano, TX with my daughter and wife. I have been in tech since 2006 building software products. I have been fortunate in my life to lead some amazing teams to deliver some marvelous products. I currently work at Capital One as a Senior Software Engineering Manager. I  build data products that help Capital One understand its petabyte scale of data better. My customers within Capital One includes the numerous data and business analysts, data scientists, risk mitigators and numerous operational wizards that make Capital One tick daily.

If you are interested in joining Capital One, drop me a line at [Anoop.KunjuramanPillai@capitalone.com](mailto:Anoop.KunjuramanPillai@capitalone.com) and I can hook you up with a recruiter.

Before Capital One, I lead teams in companies specializing in consumer electronics and embedded system programming. 

I like coding and writing about coding. I mainly code in Python and Javascript these days. I have coded in Go lang and Java in the past. I also love AWS and cloud. I also support few non-profits with their infrastructure and website development. I love the new [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/) stack (Lambdas + S3 + DynamoDB) together with [React Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) that makes it possible to run a moderate traffic site for pennies a month. This is my preferred stack as it enables hands-off operational maintainability, being completely serverless and with builtin fault tolerance (if you know what you are doing). If you are a non-profit and are looking for support, react out to me at [AnoopEngineer@gmail.com](mailto:anoopengineer@gmail.com)
