This guide shows how to do a serverless deployment of a static website to AWS using AWS SAM and how to create an automated continous integration and continous delivery pipeline.

In this guide, we will use Hugo to create a static site, but the same can be extended to Angular, React, Gatsby sites etc. We will be leveraging AWS SAM to deploy this static website in a serverless manner. Static assets will be stored in AWS S3 and content served by CloudFront's worldwide edge servers providing blazing fast content delivery to consumers. The source code for the site will be stored in GitHub and we will use AWS Code Builder to automatically build and deploy the site whenever a change is pushed to Github.

Let's get introduced to few technologies that we will use in this guide.

### Hugo

### AWS SAM

### AWS S3

### AWS CloudFront

### AWS Code Deploy

### GitHub
